The left heatmap illustrates the correlation between the stocks' daily returns, revealing generally positive but moderate relationships, such as the 0.62 correlation between NVDA and TSM, which indicates a tendency for their daily price changes to move in the same direction. In contrast, the right heatmap displays the correlation between their absolute closing prices, uncovering different and sometimes stronger relationships. Notably, it shows negative correlations, like between AMD and IONQ (-0.51), and a very strong positive correlation between the closing prices of NVDA and TSM (0.97). Together, these visualizations effectively contrast the short-term, day-to-day market dynamics with the longer-term price trends of the selected stocks.

                            Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks represent a sophisticated class of recurrent neural networks specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. 
                            LSTMs excel at learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them particularly well-suited for time series forecasting applications such as stock price prediction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The LSTM architecture incorporates three critical gates: the forget gate, input gate, and output gate. 
                            The forget gate determines what information to discard from the cell state, the input gate decides which values to update, and the output gate controls what parts of the cell state to output. 
                            This gating mechanism allows LSTMs to selectively remember or forget information over long sequences, capturing complex temporal patterns in stock price movements.
